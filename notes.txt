Day 1
-----
- I started the day with the HTML&CSS book and finished the first chapter(Structure)
- Second chapter is about adding markup to Text, so I started playing with text layouts while reading the chapter.  A simple column layout for paragraphs, is what I am trying to do.


Day 2
------
- Finished on chapter 2(text)
- Started with Chapter 3(Lists)
- Layout I was working with does not seem doable with the html properties I have been going through.
