## Day to day notes

### Day 1

- I started the day with the HTML&CSS book and finished the first chapter(Structure)
- Second chapter is about adding markup to Text, so I started playing with text layouts while reading the chapter.  A simple column layout for paragraphs, is what I am trying to do.

### Day 2
- Finished on chapter 2(text)
- Started with Chapter 3(Lists)
- Layout I was working with does not seem doable with the html properties I have been going through.

### Day 3
- Finished reading the chapter 3(lists)
- Worked more on the layout exercise, trying to use the html elements that I read about. 
- Had issues with the layout as it is a grid and I have not yet reached css properties yet. 
- Was confused about how to apply the same style to different elements, but with small differences. Kitty and Srihari helped.
- Discussed div vs lists with kitty, and when to use what. Semantics.
- Did a bit of study on the "LATCH principle" and examples of it's application with Prashant.
