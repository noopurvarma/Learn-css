## Day to day notes

### Day 1

- I started the day with the HTML&CSS book and finished the first chapter(Structure)

### Day 2

- Started with Chapter 3(Lists)
- Layout I was working with does not seem doable with the html properties I have been going through.


### Day 3
- Finished reading the chapter 3(lists)
- Worked more on the layout exercise, trying to use the html elements that I read about. 
- Had issues with the layout as it is a grid and I have not yet reached css properties yet. 
- Was confused about how to apply the same style to different elements, but with small differences. Kitty and Srihari helped.
- Discussed div vs lists with kitty, and when to use what. Semantics.
